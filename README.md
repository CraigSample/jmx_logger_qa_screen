# JMX logger qa screen

#### Purpose

To design and create a program to record JMX values from a running Cassandra instance, while checking that certain thresholds are not exceeded. Recorded metrics are graphed and analysis is provided.

#### External Requirements

A running Cassandra instance.

#### Programming Languages

* Java (11+)

##### Configuration

Please modify /src/main/java/general/WritePropertiesFile.java and populate with values that match your environment (such as IP, username, password, ports, etc. for the Cassandra instance).

When run, this will populate the config.properties file that the rest of the application may reference. Conversely, modify config.properties directly.

##### To Run

The main script is /src/test/java/TestScreen.java. Please run this script to generate the output for your environment.

##### Output

Output is logged in the /logs directory. The supporting log files of the application can be found as /logs/app.log and /logs/error.log.

Graphs and logs are also generated by cassandra-stress as supporting documentation only (example: as /graphs/cassandra-stress_2018-10-01_17:02:33.html and /logs/cassandra-stress_2018-10-01_17:02:33.log respectively).
